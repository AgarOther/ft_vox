# This is a Work-In-Progress solo "ft_vox".
Despite its name, it doesn't follow 42's subject as I'm doing this solo, has ImGUI in it and player mechanics.<br>
See this more like a personal Minecraft clone in OpenGL than anything else.<br>
But hey, if you're working on ft_vox and you're here to get help, you can check out my code and you might find what you're looking for!<br>
If you have any questions, need help with anything or just want to suggest things, **you can DM me on discord: eleowo**
